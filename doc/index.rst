Python Inpainter for Cosmological and AStrophysical SOurces
===========================================================


This package  provides a suite of inpainting methodologies aimed at
reconstructing holes on images  (128x128 pixels) extracted from a HEALPIX map.

Three inpainting techniques are included in ``PICASSO`` and can be divided into two main groups:

1. diffusive-based methods (Nearest-Neighbours)
2. learning-based methods that rely on training DCNNs to fill the missing pixels with the predictions  learned from a training data-set (Deep-Prior and Generative Adversarial Networks, GAN ).

For further details see `Puglisi et al. (2020)  <>`_.

So far,  ``PICASSO`` has been tested on  inpainting maps of   two   polarized emissions in the microwave regime: Synchrotron and Thermal Dust. GAN weights have been derived by training on  images of each emission and  can be found at : `GAN weights <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NtJ-amLBXNjbvurMtbgptPdYmpp97do7>`_.


Install
#######

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/giuspugl/picasso
    cd picasso
    python setup.py install

Usage
#####

Scripts are provided to the user in order to perform:

- projection from full sky HEALPIX maps to flat thumbnails images `image_stacker   <https://github.com/giuspugl/picasso/blob/master/picasso/image_stacker_mpi.py>`_
- inpainting on GPUs `inpaint_gpu  <https://github.com/giuspugl/picasso/blob/master/picasso/inpaint_gpu.py>`_
- parallel inpainting on multiple processes (with ``mpi4py`` ) `inpaint_mpi <https://github.com/giuspugl/picasso/blob/master/picasso/inpaint_mpi.py>`_
- projection from flat images to HEALPIX  `inpaint_gpu  <https://github.com/giuspugl/picasso/blob/master/picasso/inpaint_gpu.py>`_
